Soma is soma-ch more than a regular schmegular social media platform. Soma allows you to review live performances from an artist(s), create your own profile to save upcoming concert dates, and make sure that the artist(s) you sold your left kidney to see will be worth it. 

Soma uses P5.js to create an fun, creative home page that plays a song while you lose yourself in our spinning carousel. 

Soma also uses the Spotify API to retreive a searched artist. You can then leave a (kind, constructive) review on the artist's page.
